### Sprint 6 Design Goal: 

> The design goals for this sprint was to continue to modify the wireframes to fit into the new single page dashboard application.  As well, update design components and look to how we could design a mobile version of our new design concept.  As well, our team was going to try and return to those we originally interviewed to get their feedback on our design direction to keep a healthy feedback loop of user feedback.

>> **Results**: The result of this weekend design work focused on our backlog list, specifically the initial design thoughts and user feedback on a electronic pillbox.  There was also some re-designing of certain icons on the site (specifically related to recalls, adverse effects, and labeling changes) to make them more intuitive to a user when they first reach the site.

### Sprint 6 Development Goal:

> The development goals for this sprint was to start integrating the data into the search function to ensure the appropriate results would arrive when you searched on drug names.  Additionally the team continued to work to include design components into the final development environment as the new application page shifted from the multi-page design to a single page dashboard.

>> **Results**: Development moved forward working on the integration of the data into showing location information on the Google Maps.  This also included when you clicked on a Pin you would see manufacturer information.  We also ran test runs on the search functionality and improved load times within the development environment.  Finally we started putting in the necessary tools to allow the app to be responsive.

### Impact on Overall Project Success:

> The weekend work on this project focused on moving the application from an initial, first blush, prototype, into a more robust prototype with improved functionality and design.  We also made sure to continue to gain user feedback and to grow our backlog of items that we should consider after version 1.0 of the prototype is completed.

### Sprint 6 Retrospective 

> The main retrospective for this day is that we are continuing to discover aspects of the data are not what we originally thought they were.  This has cause some issues as our design has evolved to take into account ways to show the data that is not accurate and would cause problems for users when they would come to the site.  If given the opportunity the team would be enthralled to take some significant time to understand and clean up the data with the data owners to truly understand where user preferences and data availability intersect.

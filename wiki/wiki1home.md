### INTRODUCTION

The goal of the 18F Pool 1 Prototype submission from Applied Technical Systems Inc. was, following an iterative and open process, to allow a user to interact with data from open.fda.gov in an intuitive and user friendly fashion.

To demonstrate how the team worked about to reach this goal, it decided to use the GitHub Wiki as a way to share the story of our process and progress from the beginning of the project to the end.  

While we encourage you to drive deep into our plan, research, sprints, and other documentation, we will provide a high level overview of our project within the README.md file per the direction of the proposal.

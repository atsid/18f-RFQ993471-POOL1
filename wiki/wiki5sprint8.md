### Sprint 8 Design Goal: 

> With this being the final sprint, the design work on the prototype continues to support the development side in the areas of styling, icon development, and user feedback.  The team has continued to work and brainstorm additional backlog items based upon user feedback in the sessions that have occurred in the last two sprints.

>> **Results**: A final prototype of a new Medwatch.gov!

### Sprint 8 Development Goal:

> For the final sprint on for the development work, the team worked on some last minute troubleshooting on existing open issues and bugs, conducting final testing of the code to ensure reliability, created the necessary documentation, and finished up any final coding items to package the prototype and deploy it into the live web environment.  

>> **Results**: A final prototype of a new Medwatch.gov!

### Impact on Overall Project Success:

> The impact is that the ATS Pool 1 Team successfully completed the design and development of a prototype new Medwatch.gov page using open.FDA.gov data based upon extensive user feedback as requested by 18F.

### Sprint 8 Retrospective 

> The team very much enjoyed working on this prototype and has a list of backlog items that would be awesome to implement if given the opportunity to implement in Medwatch.gov version 2.0!

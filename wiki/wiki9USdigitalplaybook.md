The team relied upon the tenants of the [U.S. Digital Services Playbook](https://playbook.cio.gov/) to guide our design steps to create our final prototype.  As many of these have linkages into Lean Start Up and Agile methodologies (as described in our [Project Plan](https://github.com/atsid/18f-RFQ993471-POOL1/blob/master/wiki/wiki2projectplan.md)) we felt at home in ensuring we met as many of these "Plays" as possible.

|**Digital Service Plays**|**Demonstrating how we met the Plays**|
|----|----|
|1. Understand what people need|We accomplished this by interviewing users, targeted individuals in the healthcare industry, and running focus groups to find out what they would need from a product using the data sets that we were provided on [open.fda.gov](https://open.fda.gov/).|
|2. Address the whole experience, from start to finish|As we found out, via our interviews, there is a certain level of anxiety in taking medication.  Unfortunately, this information gathering, especially of a serious nature, is outside the users control.  The perception is that users have to rely on others (doctors, pharmacists and news outlets) to gain this information rather than being able to go to the information source (FDA).  Our goal is to help users go to the source of this information, rather than relying on other channels to filter the information.|
|3. Make it simple and intuitive|The current [MEDWATCH](http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/default.htm) page is not user friendly.  The team worked, via user feedback, to design a new user interface that was simple, intuitive, and informative.  We ensured it met this standard by testing information, new content, new features, and design at [key points in the development process](https://github.com/atsid/18f-RFQ993471-POOL1/blob/master/wiki/wiki3UXDresearch.md).|
|4. Build the service using agile and iterative practices|We heavily relied upon [Lean Start Up](https://github.com/atsid/18f-RFQ993471-POOL1/blob/master/wiki/wiki2projectplan.md#lean-start-up-project-aspects) and [Agile](https://github.com/atsid/18f-RFQ993471-POOL1/blob/master/wiki/wiki2projectplan.md#agile-project-aspects) principles to ensure we quickly responded to gathered user feedback.  As well, we took numerous PIVOTs based upon that feedback that are clearly present in our final prototype.  Finally, our daily sprints allowed us to iterate new concepts and designs into the final product.|
|5. Structure budgets and contracts to support delivery|ATS structured and staffed this effort to represent a realistic scenario. A time box and budget was established to ensure that the prototype and accompanying deliverables represented a level of effort commensurate with a real world project of similar scope and scale.|
|6. Assign one leader and hold that person accountable|The Product Manager for our project was Rick Lee.  He was assigned by Applied Technical Systems to lead the team and project forward to completion|
|7. Bring in experienced teams|A team of volunteers came together, with a diverse skill set and expertise, to tackle this project.  Each had strengths in design and/or development that helped the team succeed at seeing both the big picture and the smaller, but just as important, details|
|8. Choose a modern technology stack|While this project worked in Github, we understand the importance of using a modern technology stack that provides both flexibility in the development environment, security to the data and can be deployed on a variety of different hardware.  Most important, though, is our preference to use open source software solutions at every layer of the stack|
|9. Deploy in a flexible hosting environment|By using Github (and specifically Github Pages) we not only meet the needs of the proposal, but show that we are comfortable working in an open, and flexible, hosting environment|
|10. Automate testing and deployments|As demonstrated in our history of this prototype build, we tried to engage as much automatic testing as possible to find areas of improvement.|
|11. Manage security and privacy through reusable processes|Users told us in their feedback that the security of their information and data was paramount.  We developed our application to not need to gather additional information outside of linking to the existing Medwatch electronic submission form.  We understand that any changes to this require serious considerations to the protection and privacy of information from those without a need to know.|
|12. Use data to drive decisions|Customer inputs and the data generated, analyzed and aggregated from those sessions drove our product development efforts through each sprint. We documented at least 8 “pivots” in our product direction – each pivot demonstrating a data driven response to meet customer needs|
|13. Default to open|We love open and encourage our teams to design open source solutions that can be used by others.  We also are open in our internal team and external customer interactions.  When you default to open, the possibilities for collaboration and amazing solutions are endless|

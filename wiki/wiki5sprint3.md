### Sprint 3 Design Goal:

> Continued creation and modifications of wireframe(s) for the "home" page and Drug detail page (including an alert area) of the MEDWATCH web application that takes into account user feedback from team interviews and a focus group session that occurred on June 22, 2015.  

>> **Results**: At the end of Sprint 3 the team begin to apply our style sheets to the index.html page.  We also worked to create work flows for the log-in pages and continued to wireframe some of the backlog items.  Finally, we also worked on a redesign of the MEDWATCH logo, some branding, and photoshop work as a reference point on the new MEDWATCH website.

### Sprint 3 Development Goal:

> Continued Data analysis to look for useful relationships and common data across data sets that can be visualized in a unique way on the MEDWATCH application.  Building of the HTML/CSS structure for the site.

>> **Results**: Finished the index.html page to allow for further design work.  Developed and built widget APIs to tap into the open.fda.gov data streams for inclusion on the index.html page.  As well, finished setting up local development environments to then connect into github and eventually host the side on GHpages. 

### Impact on Overall Project Success:

> This sprint moved us from setting up the development environment to actually moving the wireframes from initial concept into design, then into the development environment.  Additionally, the progress made during Sprint 3 allowed us to conduct our first user/usability test since the focus group that occurred on June 22, 2015.  

### Sprint 3 Retrospective 

> The team learned from this Sprint that it needed assistance in getting the local development environment setup to move the team forward in the creation of the prototype.  As well, these delays on the development side, while not hindering the design aspects of the site, turned out to be a significant blocker that the team needed to overcome to ensure the project moved forward.

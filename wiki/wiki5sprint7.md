### Sprint 7 Design Goal: 

> For this second to last sprint, the design work is primarily being focused on styling of the developed pages and to provide styling of the new page that was a result of the latest pivot.  The team is supporting those working on the prototype in providing any styling or design materials they might need to bring the prototype over the finish line.  The team also plans to conduct one last user test.

>> **Results**: The results of this last Sprint focused our attention on how we displayed information on our prototype.  The expert user feedback changed the way that we were going to display information.  We moved the number of icons from three to two (only showing recalls and details icons).  The default Tab that shows on the map after you search for a drug name will be the recall information.  The details information will come out on a brand new page.

### Sprint 7 Development Goal:

> On the development side the team is developing a second page, outside of the main landing page dashboard concept, that holds additional information related to recalls.  The team also is working on formatting of information on the dashboard, making the necessary data changes as we gain more insight into the data, ensuring the web application is fully responsive, and continued development to make sure the application runs smoothly in the web environment.

>> **Results**: For this Sprint the development side began to plan the Pivot for our design based upon the expert user feedback to be implemented fully by the end of Sprint 8. 

### Impact on Overall Project Success:

> Once again our project team is able to see that user feedback is playing a key roll into how the final prototype will look, feel, and interact with the user.  This is our third major Pivot in our design direction since we began this design work nearly two weeks ago.  While there have also been a number of minor pivots, these major Pivots were the results of overwhelming user feedback and our continued understanding of the data.

### Sprint 7 Retrospective 

> The main takeaway from this second to last sprint is that, even up to the last minute, user feedback can drastically change the direction that your team takes within the design and development process.  This is encouraging as our process was specifically designed to be iterative and we worked to consistently take in user feedback for each subsequent Sprint or release.  Such information has also been key in the populating of our project backlog so we would be set up to begin version 2.0 once 1.0 was released.

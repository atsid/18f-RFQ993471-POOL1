### Sprint 2 Design Goal:

> Creation of wireframe(s) for the "home" page and Drug detail page (including an alert area) of the MEDWATCH web application that takes into account user feedback from team interviews and a focus group session that occurred on June 22, 2015.  

>> **Results**: The design team on the project was able to create wireframes for a redesigned website application and used the information from the previous days focus group to detail future design considerations.

### Sprint 2 Development Goal:

> Data analysis to look for useful relationships and common data across data sets that can be visualized in a unique way on the MEDWATCH application.  This includes a review of the Kendo UI and Theme Builder.

>> **Results**:  The team came back with new data information and insights that pivoted our focus to what the data could support through visualizations that would be user focused.  As well, we determined that Kendo UI was not open source, so pivoted to consider new technologies.

### Impact on Overall Project Success:

> This continued to allow the project to develop appropriate foundational steps, based upon the gathered user feedback information, to move the project forward into Sprint 3.

### Sprint 2 Retrospective

> The main takeaway from Sprint 2 is that the team has a significant amount of information to continue to digest.  As well, the team needs to continue to develop and build the necessary components of the site to ensure a high-level of functionality.  Finally, the team was required to delay for another day user-testing on the site until the wireframes could be transitioned into an environment to allow productive user-testing sessions.

### **Summary:** 
The Pool 1 Team for ATS purposely focused on utilizing an iterative approach that provided multiple user feedback points that informed our subsequent work and final version of the prototype.  Following a condensed version of the methodology promoted by the Lean Startup and Agile project management trains of thought, this project plan encompasses all the steps from our initial kick-off to prototype submission.

In using both of these methodologies, we focused on the user.  Nearly everyday we looked for opportunities to gain user feedback to help direct the team on next steps, pivot points, and the final solution.  All told, the design you are seeing in our prototype in influenced by the following factors:

* RFP Requirements as set forth by 18F
* Feedback gained by interviews, user focus groups, user feedback, and user tests
* Analysis of the data on open.FDA.gov
* Team expertise in the area of user experience design and development

Additionally the team utilized as many of the [U.S. Digital Services Playbook](https://playbook.cio.gov/) plays as possible.  An explanation and/or demonstration of these activities can be found [HERE](https://github.com/atsid/18f-RFQ993471-POOL1/blob/master/wiki/wiki9USdigitalplaybook.md).

Finally, the team ensured that we stayed true to the five key principles that guide all the work that 18F does:

|Key 18F Principles|
|----|
|Put the needs of users first|
|Release early, iteratively, and often|
|Don't slow down delivery|
|Only do it if it adds value|
|Work in the open|


### **Lean Start-Up Project Aspects:**

"It favors experimentation over elaborate planning, customer feedback over intuition, and iterative design over traditional development" -  [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2013/05/why-the-lean-start-up-changes-everything)

>**Listen to the Customer**

>>The team heavily relied upon the Lean Start-Up concept when it came to the "Listen to the Customer" to help influence our design and usage consideration.  In our focus group, interviews, and user feedback sessions, we used our audience/users to discuss ideas we experimented with looking for validation to search out appropriate solutions.

>>What became apparent in using this was that we **pivoted** numerous times as our users validated (or invalidated) the features we were thought would be useful.  One of these pivots, which was significant, was our original intention to introduce user profiles.  After strong feedback, this plan was put on the backlog, as the feedback demonstrated significant push back against providing personal information to a government agency.  We also utilized a [Lean Startup Canvas](https://github.com/atsid/18f-RFQ993471-POOL1/blob/master/documentation/Research/Lean%20Startup%20Canvases.pptx)

>**User Centered/Responsive Development**

>>The team spent the beginning of the project doing initial planning.  In doing so we thought of how the existing data on open.FDA.gov could be improved from a user centered standpoint.  What grabbed our attention  was the  FDA program entitled **[MEDWATCH](http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/)**, which is the FDA's Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program.

>>The team quickly saw that if a user came to this page they would quickly be deterred and become frustrated when trying to located pertinent information for recalls.  The team felt that using the data from open.FDA.gov, which seems to be a central component of MEDWATCH, to improve the MEDWATCH user experience would be a worthwhile prototype to build.

>>Once the project was selected the team went into following the general development process prescribed by Lean Start-up via _Planning_, _Requirements_, _Analysis & Design_, _Implementation_, _Testing_, and finally _Evaluation_.  The team was able to complete one iteration of this process, as detailed below:

>>|**Step**|**Tool Used**|
|----|----|
|Planning|Brainstorming/Data Analysis/Research|
|Requirements|Interviews/Focus Groups|
|Analysis & Design|Wireframing/Persona Development|
|Implementation|Development of the Design|
|Testing|User Testing|
|Evaluation|Heuristic Review|

### **Agile Project Aspects:**

"Probing a bit deeper reveals that most of this agility starts and ends with the product development teams – specifically software engineering. There is rarely a mention of “agile in the HR group” or “continuous improvement in finance.” And yet, it is in these infrastructural disciplines that agility must take root to support software-driven businesses." - [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2014/11/bring-agile-to-the-whole-organization)

>**Following the Principles**

>>The team's goal was to follow, as well we could, the 12 agile principles that define the agile development process.  We understood that agile can be used in multiple facets of this project, not just the design and development of the prototype.  The following tasks show how we worked to meet the 12 agile principles:

>>|**Agile Principle**|**How did we meet the Principle?**|
|----|----|
|Customer satisfaction by rapid delivery of useful software|Through day long sprints, the team developed a prototype that was reviewed by users during user testing|
|Welcome changing requirements, even late in development|Based upon user feedback, we encouraged the inclusion of new requirements/design ideas in the late stages of development that greatly impacted the final design and workings of the prototype|
|Working software is delivered frequently (weeks rather than months)|After initial sprints to set up wireframe designs and the development structure, we delivered a working prototype early and improved it daily|
|Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers|Via user feedback and focus groups, we created user feedback loops that allowed users (aka business people) to work directly with developers to influence the final design of the prototype|
|Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted|The entire team worked together, pushing each other to succeed, to develop a impactful prototype solution|
|Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)|The team created a "war room" that allowed designers and developers to work together, as well as bring in users to provide feedback.  When not able to be their in person, team members were brought in using Google hangouts|
|Working software is the principal measure of progress|By Sprint 4, we were able to demonstrate usable software|
|Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace|Each day showed measured improvement and progress on the final prototype.  While some days had more progress than others, the trajectory was sustainable and did not cause burnout on the team|
|Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design|The team kept a keen eye to ensure both design and development aspects achieved best practices.  As well, the team had a goal to achieve an excellent, rather than just good, design|
|Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential|The team kept an active product backlog for future implementation.  By taking smaller steps, in keeping the goals manageable and achievable, the team succeeded in "keeping it simple"|
|Self-organizing teams|The team members stepped up and organized themselves into smaller working groups to tackle different aspects of the prototype.  Our "leader" focused on pushing the team towards the final goal, while allowing these self-organized teams to search out their own unique solutions to problems/blockers they ran into|
|Regular adaptation to changing circumstance|Following our Lean Startup aspects, the team regularly pivoted certain aspects of the project when presented new information, design concepts, blockers, and other feedback.  In doing so, the team was able to bend, but not break, when recognizing the pivots that needed to occur|

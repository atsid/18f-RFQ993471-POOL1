### Sprint 5 Design Goal: 

> Continue to work on design stories and research into our PIVOT into the new design concept.  Take conclusions from Sprint 4 user testing to define new items in the project backlog.  Take time to re-interview past interviewee's to gain additional feedback on the new design (via the Photoshop concept). Mock-up mobile application ideas in Omnigraffle.

>> **Results**: This results of this sprint continued our pivot to a new design for the Medwatch.gov homepage.  We completed some whiteboard exercises to help map out the new dashboard concept for the page. As well, we begun to discuss next steps in the expansion of the page, to include a mobile version.

### Sprint 5 Development Goal:

> Continue to work on visualizations and linking data into the Google Map API as a central focus on the webpage.  Shift the application design from multiple pages to a single page web application per the PIVOT after receiving user feedback at the end of Sprint 4.  In doing so there will be focused work on the index.html page and conduct a check in to ensure the map element is styled accordingly.

>> **Results**: The success of this part of the sprint was the initial integration of the Google Map API and initial functionality of the new dashboard design page.

### Impact on Overall Project Success:

> The impact on the overall project was that we continued to refine our direction based upon new user feedback.  We felt that, initially, we were on the right track with a multiple page design that used the database components.  The latest user feedback told us to refine again, which set the project off in a different, but positive direction.

### Sprint 5 Retrospective 

> The most important part of this project is the users.  We are reminded of this daily as we work to get new, fresh eyes, on our prototype design and functionality.  We understand the importance of this user engagement in creating a successful design that is intuitive and useful, both to the FDA, but to those users interacting with the new Medwatch page.

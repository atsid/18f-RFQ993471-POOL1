#####1 - Assigned one leader, gave that person authority and responsibility, and held that person accountable for the quality of the prototype submitted
> **Evidence** - Rick Lee was assigned as the leader for this project.  In this role he prioritizes actions for sprints, makes final decisions, assigns project items to individuals, and ensure that a quality prototype is submitted on time.

#####2 - Assembled a multidisciplinary and collaborative team that includes at a minimum of three of the labor categories limited to the Design Pool Labor categories to design the prototype as quoted in Attachment C.
> **Evidence** -  The Pool 1 team is made up of six individuals.  These individuals are as follows

>>|Name|Category Name|
|----|----|
|Rick Lee|Product Manager|
|Pete Oliver-Krueger|Front End Web Designer|
|Terese Villia|Writer/Content Designer/Content Strategist & Interaction Designer/User Researcher/Usability testing|
|Brian Ingles|Visual Designer|
|Derek Gesin|Interaction Designer/User Researcher/Usability Tester|
|Jason Rodgers|Front End Web Designer|

#####3 - Understand what people need, by including people in the prototype design process
> **Evidence** - The team used a highly focused process to ensure a continuous feedback loop throughout the entire design process.  Specifically, the team conducted the following during the entire process:

>>|Date|Activity|
|----|----|
|June 19, 2015|Sent out internal ATS survey to determine who would be interested in participating in focus groups or user tests|
|June 19, 2015|Developed a questionnaire, interview script, and plan to receive feedback from internal and external sources to help set the path for prototype design|
|June 20-21, 2015|Conducted Interviews.  Feedback on internal interviews is located [HERE](https://github.com/atsid/18f-RFQ993471-POOL1/wiki/2.-UXD-Research-&-Data-Research-Documentation#initial-internal-ats-user-interview-documentation), external [HERE](https://github.com/atsid/18f-RFQ993471-POOL1/wiki/2.-UXD-Research-&-Data-Research-Documentation#initial-external-ats-user-interview-documentation)|
|June 22, 2015|Conducted Focus Group after Sprint 1.  Feedback on Focus Group is located [HERE](https://github.com/atsid/18f-RFQ993471-POOL1/wiki/2.-UXD-Research-&-Data-Research-Documentation#june-22-2015-focus-group-documentation)|
|June 23, 2015|User/usability testing canceled due to development work|
|June 24, 2015|User/usability testing canceled due to development work|
|June 25, 2015|Conducted user/usability testing after Sprint 4, results located [HERE](https://github.com/atsid/18f-RFQ993471-POOL1/wiki/2.-UXD-Research-&-Data-Research-Documentation#june-25-2015-user-tests)|
|June 29, 2015|Conducted user/usability testing after Sprint 7, results located [HERE](https://github.com/atsid/18f-RFQ993471-POOL1/wiki/2.-UXD-Research,-UXD-Wireframes-&-Data-Research-Documentation#june-29-2015-final-user-test)|

#####4 - Used at least three "human-centered design" techniques or tools
> **Evidence** - As demonstrated in our [Lean Start-Up](https://github.com/atsid/18f-RFQ993471-POOL1/wiki/1.-Project-Plan#lean-start-up-project-aspects) part of our project plan we utilized user interviews, focus groups, testing, and heuristic reviews of our prototype by subject matter experts.  A detailed repository of all of our research is located on our [UXD Research, UXD Wireframes & Data Research Documentation](https://github.com/atsid/18f-RFQ993471-POOL1/wiki/2.-UXD-Research,-UXD-Wireframes-&-Data-Research-Documentation) wiki page.

#####5 - Created or used a design style guide and/or a pattern library
> **Evidence** - We chose to utilize the USPTO pattern library (which ATS helped develop) as a foundation for many of the individual components used on the application.  In addition, we created a custom icon font for use in this application utilizing "font awesome" as a starting point for the MEDWATCH Application.

#####6 - Used at least three modern and open-source frontend or client-side web technologies
> **Evidence** The modern and open-source frontend development tools we used included AngularJS, JQuery, Bootstrap, Angular-UI/UI-Router, RaphaelJS, Less.JS, HTML5, CSS3, and Google Maps Javascript API.

#####7 - Performed usability tests with people
> **Evidence** - The team performed two user/usability tests during the process.  The first usability test focused upon created wireframes and data interactions.  The second, and final, usability test was the final test before prototype finalization and submission.  Both of these tests occurred at the end of a day long sprint.

|June 25, 2015|Conducted user/usability testing after Sprint 4, results located [HERE](https://github.com/atsid/18f-RFQ993471-POOL1/wiki/2.-UXD-Research-&-Data-Research-Documentation#june-25-2015-user-tests)|

#####8 - Used an iterative approach, where feedback informed subsequent work or versions of the prototype
> **Evidence** - As demonstrated in our [project plan](https://github.com/atsid/18f-RFQ993471-POOL1/wiki/1.-Project-Plan), we focused on using a lean start-up methodology that allowed us to receive consistent feedback, design to meet that feedback, pivot to new ideas when the original ideas weren't supported by that feedback, and prioritized usability features to ensure both the pre-prototype and prototype work was customer centered.

#####9 - Created a prototype that works on multiple devices, and presents a responsive design
> **Evidence** - Our prototype is designed to work on all major web browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Internet Explorer) and is designed to be responsive to the device it is being accessed on.  Our prototype can be accessed by going to this link:

#####10 - Provided sufficient documentation to install and run their prototype on another machine 
> **Evidence** - Information on how a developer can install and run their prototype on another machine can be found in the [DeveloperREADME.md](https://github.com/atsid/18f-RFQ993471-POOL1/blob/master/DeveloperREADME.md).

#####11 - Prototype and underlying platforms used to create and run the prototype are openly licensed and free of charge 
> **Evidence** - Our prototype uses only openly licensed and sourced platforms that can be used free of charge.  The listing of our platforms used can be found in our response to question 6.  As well, by using Github Pages, we made sure our prototype is easily accessible.

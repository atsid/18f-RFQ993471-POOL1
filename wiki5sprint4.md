### Sprint 4 Design Goal: 
> Continue to develop icons, images, and other aspects of the design being made in Photoshop as a guide to then be moved into the development environment.  Work on the work flow for the log-in page and begin to wire frame backlog items.  Apply styles to finished pages.  Conduct user testing.

>> **Results**: The main results of this sprint from the design standpoint was the user testing and the feedback received from those tests.  It allowed us to understand what to improve in the design and expected functionality of the site.  It also allowed us to explore possible new pivot points in future sprints.

### Sprint 4 Development Goal: 
> Continue to finalize development environment.  Build widget APIs to tap into the data and send out to team for inclusion onto the Index page.  Work on containers and box in the map component of the index page.

>> **Results**: The main result of this sprint on the development side was to make sure everyone was on the same page in Github on the ability to check in and out code without causing continued errors.  Additionally, the team was able to set up the URL on Github Pages and set up the live environment to review the data.  Finally, the team realized that, if given the time, we would of preferred to take time to clean up the data and work with the FDA to achieve better data streams for more meaningful results.


### Impact on Overall Project Success:

> The impact of this sprint on the overall project was extremely positive.  We were able to conduct user testing for the first time since the initial focus group.  This gave us some really good insights and allowed us to refine our design in such a way that met a users need. 

### Sprint 4 Retrospective:

> The use of data is a central part of this project.  As such, one of the things that has become apparent to the team after the last four sprints is that having clean data is even more important.  We've realized that our initial understanding of the data set isn't actual what the data set is reporting.  For instance, geo-location data was originally thought to be related to the location of the recall or incident, whereas it is actually the location of the manufacturer.  

> This realization makes it increasingly important to the team to continue to understand the data, how it is interrelated, and what interesting themes can be gleaned that would be helpful for a user.

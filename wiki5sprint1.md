### Sprint 1 Design Goal:

> Wireframe(s) for the main page of the MEDWATCH web application that takes into account user feedback from team interviews and a focus group session that occurred on June 22, 2015.  

>> **Results**:  Design work ended up not occurring as additional user feedback from the focus group changed our focus.  Information taken from the focus group resulted in the setting out of two design goals for Sprint 2 - designing the "home" page wires and the drug detail page wires. 

### Sprint 1 Development Goal:

> Development of the portal aspects, to include log-in, profile, and authentication of user profiles.  Development of the backbone of the MEDWATCH web application.

>> **Results**:  After further user studies it was determined there is very little interest in users creating profiles and submitting their medical information to the FDA/Federal Government.  This resulted in a pivot to look at how we can find meaningful relationships in the data that can be visualized.

### Impact on Overall Project Success:

> The overarching project goal of Sprint 1 begins the process of the design team working from the "end state" design to the "beginning state", whereas the development team works from the "beginning state" to the "end state".  This allows the development team to work on items that don't need a large design influence and the design team to work on design components to transfer to the development team in later sprints.

### Sprint 1 Retrospective

> Keeps the entire team engaged in all parts of the project while continuing to move towards the finish line.  As well the feedback from the focus group resulted in a significant pivot away from the goal to personalize the experience with the use of user profiles and submission of drug information to the FDA.  The new direction focuses on information visualization, data relationships, and search.
